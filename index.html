They bloom in late spring to early summer; flower colors include pink, red, violet, yellow, and white, depending on the species and variety. Size also varies considerably, from 1 or 2 feet to over 20 feet in height, so choose plants carefully to fit your garden situation. Although the distinction isn't clearcut, in general rhododendrons are evergreen, while most azaleas are deciduous (although there are evergreen types).</p>

				<div class="section-title style3">cow</div>
				<p>Cow is the national animal of Nepal. Most of the people of Nepal are Hindus and cow is worshipped as the goddess of wealth.Killing of cow is prohibited in the hindu religion and in Nepal.The cow has been a part of our civilisation since forever,revered by some and just treated as a road-blocking nuisance by others. But it is this humble animal that has gone on to become the national animal of Nepal.There were a tough competition between the cow and the one-horned rhino but then,looks like simplicity won over extravagance.
